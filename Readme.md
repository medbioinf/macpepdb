# MaCPepDB - Mass Centric Peptide Database

MaCPepDB creates and maintains a peptide database and provides a web API for accessing the database.

Note: This is the next iteration of MaCPepDB, moving from the [previous Python-implementation](https://github.com/mpc-bioinformatics/macpepdb) to Rust and using ScyllaDB instead of PostgreSQL / Citus, in order to get better performance and make MaCPepDB ready to include more data.

## Ambiguous amino acids

Some UniProt entries contain one letter codes which encode multiple amino acids. Usually the encoded amino acids
have a similar or equal mass. Ambiguous one letter codes are:

* `B` encodes `D` & `N`
* `J` encodes `I` & `L`
* `Z` encodes `E` & `Q`

Because the amino acids encoded by `B` & `Z` have a different mass and only a few hundreds entries contain these, MaCPepDB resolves the ambiguity by creating all possible combination of the peptide with the distinct amino acids, e.g.:

| ambiguous peptide | distinct peptides |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `PE_B_TIDE_Z_K`   | `PE_D_TIDE_E_K`   |
|                   | `PE_D_TIDE_Q_K`   |
|                   | `PE_N_TIDE_E_K`   |
|                   | `PE_N_TIDE_Q_K`   |

`J` encodes Leucine and Isoleucine, both have the same mass. Resolving those would not make the peptides better distinguishable by mass.

In theory `X` is also ambiguous, encoding **all** amino acids. Practically a lot more entries containing `X` than the previous mentioned ambiguous amino acids, sometimes with a high abundance of `X`. Resolving these would increase the amount of peptides significantly and slowing down MaCPepDB's search functionality.

## Input

* Protein data are provided by UniProt Text/EMBL format (
  * [Documentation](https://web.expasy.org/docs/userman.html)
  * [Source](https://ftp.expasy.org/databases/uniprot/) (dat-files) or on UniProt download as `Text`
* Taxonomy data are provided
  * [Documentation](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump_readme.txt)
  * [Source](https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/) (taxdump.zip)

## Database structure

MaCPepDB utilizes a denormalized database structure for efficient record storage and compatibility with various database engines. Denormalization consolidates data into fewer tables, minimizing redundant data such as multi-column primary key of peptides. However, this approach may result in a loss of certain SQL functionalities, such as foreign keys and cascade operations that ensure database integrity. To compensate for this, the lost functionality is implemented in the application code. Manual alterations to the database are discouraged and should be done using MaCPepDB.

### Blobs

Table to store several binary data. Scylla blob type has in practice a limit of < 1MB, therefore data is stored in multiple chunks of max 512KB. Each chunk has a prefix and chunk index as key.

## Scylla Cluster Deployment

### Install Scylla

[Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.scylladb.com/download/?platform=ubuntu-22.04&version=scylla-5.2#open-source)

### Configure

For every node in the cluster:

Edit `/etc/scylla/scylla.yaml` and

* set the seed to the IP of the first node in the cluster
* Set listen-address and rpm-address to the IP of the current node
* Set the same cluster name
* Use GossipingPropertyFileSnitch as a snitch

Edit `/etc/scylla/cassandra-rackdc.properties` and

* uncomment and name dc and rack

### Scylla Setup

For every node in the cluster:

* Run `scylla_setup` and use XFS setup on the desired drive
* Don’t use io tuner during setup
* Enable dev mode: `sudo scylla_dev_mode_setup —developer_mode 1`
* `sudo systemctl start scylla-server`

You can try using io tuner for your disk, however in some cases the performance with io tuner and non-devmode seems worse than performance with no iotuner and devmode enabled

## Usage

### Web API

`cargo run -r web scylla://<COMMA_SEPARATED_SCYLLA_NODES_LIST>/<KEYSPACE/DATABASE> <IP> <PORT>`
