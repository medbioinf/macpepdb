# MaCPepDB - Mass Centric Peptide Database

MaCPepDB creates and maintains a peptide database and provides a web API for accessing the database.

## Ambiguous amino acids

Some UniProt entries contain one letter codes which encode multiple amino acids. Usually the encoded amino acids
have a similar or equal mass. Ambiguous one letter codes are:

- `B` encodes `D` & `N`
- `J` encodes `I` & `L`
- `Z` encodes `E` & `Q`

Because the amino acids encoded by `B` & `Z` have a different mass and only a few hundreds entries contain these, MaCPepDB resolves the ambiguity by creating all possible combination of the peptide with the distinct amino acids, e.g.:

| ambiguous peptide | distinct peptides |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `PE_B_TIDE_Z_K`   | `PE_D_TIDE_E_K`   |
|                   | `PE_D_TIDE_Q_K`   |
|                   | `PE_N_TIDE_E_K`   |
|                   | `PE_N_TIDE_Q_K`   |

`J` encodes Leucine and Isoleucine, both have the same mass. Resolving those would not make the peptides better distinguishable by mass.

In theory `X` is also ambiguous, encoding **all** amino acids. Practically a lot more entries containing `X` than the previous mentioned ambiguous amino acids, sometimes with a high abundance of `X`. Resolving these would increase the amount of peptides significantly and slowing down MaCPepDB's search functionality.

  )

## Database structure

MaCPepDB utilizes a denormalized database structure for efficient record storage and compatibility with various database engines. Denormalization consolidates data into fewer tables, minimizing redundant data such as multi-column primary key of peptides. However, this approach may result in a loss of certain SQL functionalities, such as foreign keys and cascade operations that ensure database integrity. To compensate for this, the lost functionality is implemented in the application code. Manual alterations to the database are discouraged and should be done using MaCPepDB.
